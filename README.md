After discovering my passion for front-end development, I couldnâ€™t get enough. I made websites for friends and family, interned with a local business, and hired myself out as a freelancer. Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing that passion to a full-time role. Currently looking for a front end development role ideally working on the UI with React and Next JS. I'd especially love to work for a startup on a tight knit team where i can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring,let's chat!
